If this rule is violated, you will be blacklisted from TJH Development and any other servers 
affilated with TJH Development and you will not be able to buy assets in the future.
Claiming ownership to any of my assets are forbidden. An example of this is posting a image or 
reposting stating its yours if it's notScripts and Vehicles are sold as is and will not include any 
updates or changes in the future. You will need to rebuy the asset at it's updated price.
Assets made by TJH Development are able to be used for either your personal use or RP group. 
If you bought an asset for personal use and want to use it in a RP group, that is fine.
All sales are final. There are no refunds of anything, PayPal says in there terms and 
conditions that digital good's are not refundable. Trying to issue a unjust refund will
get you blacklisted from my discord. Unless I give you an exact date that a project will 
be done, there is no exact date that i can give you for sure due to the fact that I have 
a life outside of discord and have other things to take care of...
